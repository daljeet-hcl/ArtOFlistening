## Chapter 1


### The Art of Listening 


Scientific method has 8 important steps (quote from wikipedia )

“
1. Define a question
2. Gather information and resources (observe)
3. Form an explanatory hypothesis
4. Test the hypothesis by performing an experiment and collecting data in a reproducible manner
5. Analyze the data
6. Interpret the data and draw conclusions that serve as a starting point for new hypothesis
7. Publish results
8. Retest (frequently done by other scientists)
“

The second is most important, it means to observer, to Observe is to listen, to listen to subject of study. Sometimes this object of Study is the universe itself.

Hypothesis will keep on changing and improving either by us or by others based on their observation. They may or may not use our hypothesis for the initial start. Our hypothesis or theories will become wrong tomorrow, they will be improved on and will become the thing of past.
What will remain appreciable is our attitude of Observation and Listening. 

### Observation becomes Science 

When we observe plants, it becomes botany, when we observe animals and their behaviour it becomes Zoology. 
Listening is imperative to Science, If we can listen better we can become better at doing science.
To Listen we need an empty uncluttered mind. We need to let go all our assumptions, everything we think we know about a subject.

Similarly When we observe our soul, We need to let go our hypothesis and theories about the soul, because theories and hypothesis can not become perfect, they will always be improved upon and will always need improvement.  
What would be important is our attitude of Observation of Phenomenon, our attitude to listen to our surrounding , our attitude to listen to our environment, Our attitude to listen to own thoughts and to our soul and if possible to other people’s soul (through both their verbal and nonverbal communications). 

We may not ‘know’, To Know is not the goal, Knowledge will never be final, it will always be listening and learning, knowledge is a process which decays when it stops flowing. It is not a noun but a verb. It should always be like the beginning of the process, water is always fresh at the glaciers.
Knowledge should be like that, when we understand that we have just begun and it would always be like we have just begun.

We will continue to Observe , we will continue to listen.

In many of our spiritual traditions we have chanting of Mantras, any mantra when I chant I try to listen to the sound, I try to listen with an empty mind, I try to increase my listening potential and I try to increase my observation potential which moves me towards silence. Then I try to listen to the silence. There is no rush, no hurry to reach somewhere , to know something , even to reach silence.
The only goal is increase my listening potential , my potential for observation.

Because to Listen is to Understand. And to Understand and to be understood is a deep grained human need.
 
### Two important steps of scientific method

1. To observe
2. To create hypothesis

For me To observe is to listen , and to create hypothesis is to speak, and both listening and then speaking are an important part of any Communication. 
All logic is hypothesis, to create logic is to hypothesise. To hypothesise is to communicate,  to unclutter. To unclutter the self. And help unclutter others if I can .  ( “perhaps by listening to them”.)

## Chapter 2

### Communication from the Soul


Mathematics or logic is a language.
And languages are used for communications.
Every Man is social.
He needs to communicate, He needs a medium of self-expression. He communicates with his eyes, movement of hands,  facial expression.
But at a certain period in the history of evolution, He discovers words and then he discovers language. An excellent tool for expressing himself.
He starts communicating not only with others in this language but also his own self, He uses this language to form arguments and with arguments he creates logic.
And since the building blocks of logic is words, a tool for communication, Can we start seeing logic as means of communication, Not only a means to communicate with others but also as means to communicate with your own self, your soul.
       Can we start seeing logic not as an end but as a means to unclutter? and if mathematics was a language, and every equation expressed by Mathematics represents an idea, Can Mathematical problem solving be seen as an unconscious effort of the soul to communicate with himself?
     An artist communicates by his art, A piece of art is not just strokes of colour on a canvas or a mould of clay in a pattern but a representation of ideas from an evolving soul.Somewhere I read cooking is an art and Art is a form communication, Dance is also a communication. All arts can be seen as an art of communication either with others or with your own self, The better we learn to communicate with others the better we can learn to become at communicating with our own self. Both have at least one common need, the clarity of thought ideas and mind.
    Communication is so central to our existence, Can we start seeing Mathematics and Sciences as an extension to our means of communication, If Mathematics is a language then science is also a language and All Languages are basically Art.




## Chapter 3

“Not only we communicate with others But also to our own self. When we think we are actually communicating with ourselves.”


### Communication is a bliss


When we communicate correctly with our inside we are at bliss, when we are not able to do that we feel miserable!
